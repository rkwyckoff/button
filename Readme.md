ReadMe for Angular Button project by Kurt Wyckoff Mar 14, 2016

1)Learned how to install Angular framework through a series of well-documented steps
2)Created 2 buttons and used Angular directives  within HTML to provide dynamic reloading
3)Controlled the activity of the buttons with a Button Controller(innate click handling, and increment/decrement functions) and invoked a increment counter on one button and a decrement counter on the other
4)Dynamically displayed a counter using Angular's $scope
5)Added a second button, which upon click, decrements the counter
